<h2 id="content">Overview</h2>
<p>FRC, or First Robotics Competition, is an international organization that hosts competitions where high schools around the globe compete in an anually released robotics challenge/game. Every January, the game is released to all the teams on the same day. From there, they have about 2 months to build a full robot from the ground up before the first round of competitions. </p>

		<h3>Build Season</h3>
		<p>The Build season starts immediately after the game is released every year in January. Students on every team go through an extensive designing and prototyping process before competitions start in March. At the kickoff when the game is released, students begin analyzing game elements to determine the most important robot functions. After creating and testing a series of prototypes, the team votes on the best design and creates a CAD (computer aided design) model of the full robot. Then, they begin fabricating and assembling the first version of the robot based on the CAD. As the season progresses, the team will later refine and make changes as needed.</p>

		<h3>Competitions</h3>
		<p>In each competition, teams play matches in randomized groups of 3, called alliances. 2 alliances face each other in each match. There are points that you get for scoring that determine a win or a loss in each match. There are also special points, called Ranking Points, that you obtain from completing special challenges during each game. These Ranking Points determine your standing in the competition. The teams who place eighth or higher become alliance captains in the playoffs.</p>
