We are a student led, mentor guided team originating from Madison High School in Vienna, Virginia. We work together as a group to design, fabricate, and program a robot every year to participate in competitions with the rules/challenge annually released by FIRST Robotics.

We are split up into seven subteams, two of which are competition specific (used only during or relating to competitions). Learn more about these subteams under the Subteam tab. 

There are also opportunities to win awards throughout the competition season for exceptional work in a certain subteam or other field. We have won multiple in past years, including both the Excellence In Engineering (for having a cleverly designed and fabricated robot) and the Autonomous (for having well thought out code to run during the autonomous period of the match) awards last season in 2025.
