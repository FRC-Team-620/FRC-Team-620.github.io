We are a student led, mentor guided team originating from Madison High School in Vienna, Virginia. We work together as a group to design, fabricate, and program a robot every year to participate in competitions with the rules/challenge annually released by FIRST Robotics.

We are split up into seven subteams, two of which are competition specific (used only during or relating to competitions).
