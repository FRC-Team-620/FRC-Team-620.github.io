			<h2>Purpose of Subteams</h2>
		</header>
		<p>We split our team into multiple different disiplines, called subteams, to organize different tasks. We use subteams to help streamline decison making and ease cooperation. They allow us to get multiple jobs done at once, which saves a lot of time in a season where it is very important and limited. </p>

					<h3>Fabrication</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Fabrication is the process by which the team turns designs into real robots. Bandsaws, 3D printers, drills, bolts, and the like allow the team to cut, print, and shape each individual component. From there, everything gets assembled according to the design plan. Once finished, the bot is ready for electronics. Fabrication is; the fabrication process; to make fabricants</p>

					<h3>Electronics</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Electronics is the subteam responsible for powering the bot. A central battery supplies power to the Power Distribution Hub (PDH), which disperses it across the robot. The robo rio is the brains of the operation; like the power distributor, it's connected to all the moving parts. Its job is to tell them when & how to move. It also connects to a radio, which allows the drivers to operate the bot from afar. Here we do wiring; the bot drinks battery juice; indubitably</p>

					<h3>Programming</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The programming team's job is to put the robot that design and fabrication have built into action. Using tools like Java and GitHub, they code the movement of robot mechanisms, autonomous routines, and driver input. The programming team is a great way to learn the many ways in which code can be applied and about software development in the real world while working with experienced mentors.</p>

			<h2>Additional Competition Subteams</h2>
		</header>
		<p> Strategy: The strategy team has two main focuses: analyzing the game, and making decisions at competitions. At the beginning of the season, the strategy team is heavily involved in the initial robot design process, examining the newly revealed game in an attempt to figure out the best match/robot configuration strategy for any given year. Once the team gets to competition season, the strategy team's role evolves. At comps, the subteam manages scouts in the stands who watch matches for info on teams, collaborates with the drive team to develop match strategies, and uses scout data to create a pick order for alliance selection.</p>

		<p> Drive: The drive team is essential to 620's success at competitions. On every drive team there is a driver, operator, human player, and coach. While the driver and operator pilot the robot, the drive coach directs them and communicates with other teams. The human player, whose role varies from year to year, takes care of other interactions with the game and game pieces. Each year, prospective drive teams must go through a selection process involving heavy levels of participation at preseason competitions, ensuring the team has multiple competent teams. The drive team is something 620 does especially well, and has contributed greatly to the Warbots' recent accomplishments.<p>
